#Windows Terminal Customization

This is my customization setup for Windows Terminal, tailored entirely to my preferences. I believe I've struck a balance between functionality and performance, avoiding overloading it with unnecessary elements.
##Modules Used:

- Oh My Posh
- Posh Git
- Terminal Icons

##Personal Recommendation:

I highly recommend using CURL to install these modules for a quick and seamless setup.
